# Welcome to Kingdom Of Shadows!

This website is designed for a [tattoo studio](https://denysrudenko.github.io/Project-1.-Tatto-studio./).

## Introduction
**Kingdom of Shadows** is a tattoo studio that provides variety of services for the clients. The owner is a talented experienced artist, who now wants to attract clients via Internet. As we know having a website is not a key to successful growth, but excellent presentation is. So for me as for developer it is extremely important to define the philosophy of the business and present the work of the studio.

In modern world respectful business must have an on-line page to grow. This especially applies to the tattoo salons, because it is a number one wish for the clients to assure themselves that their expectations meet the reality.

The choice of the color scheme for the website promoting a business like this plays a huge role in creating the image of the studio in user's eyes. In this design I used Webkit to adjust colors.I style the scroll bar and made a lot of hover effects.

Example:
* background: -webkit-linear-gradient(#bba14f, #f7ef8a, #d2ac47, #edc967);
*   -webkit-background-clip: text;
*   -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;

Informative and qualitative content for business is one of the best ways to present the work it does. Examples of the work for tattoo saloons are the bridge between klients and business, since many people decide to attend a studio based on the already made designs. My mission was to provide visitors with high resolution pictures, that can be seen and analyzed by the client making a decision. It was also important to display as many different pictures of tattoos as possible, to show divers designs, that artist can do.

What i did?
* Each background image was edited with width and height.
* Each background image was styled with a different style.
* The text of background images were moved for the user accessibility.
