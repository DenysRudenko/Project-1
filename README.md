# Welcome to Kingdom Of Shadows!

This website is designed for a [tattoo studio](https://denysrudenko.github.io/Project-1.-Tatto-studio./).

## Introduction
**Kingdom of Shadows** is a tattoo studio that provides variety of services for the clients. The owner is a talented experienced artist, who now wants to attract clients via Internet. As we know having a website is not a key to successful growth, but excellent presentation is. So for me as for developer it is extremely important to define the philosophy of the business and present the work of the studio.
